A while ago when twitter hit a point where it just wasn't fun for me anymore I had an idea. What if we all just went back to having individual blogs. Not in a boring or nerdy way but in a that let's people just put there stuff online. That's what I wanted. A home online. A home for short form twitter style posts, longer form researched blog posts, and even videos if that's something I wanted to pursue again. 


After throwing that idea around for a while I moved on from it. I had thrown together something using Sanity.io as a backend but it still didn't stick for me. Mostly because the way I built it out meant I needed a title and had to maintain another system on top of fighting with nextjs.


While all of this was happening I was also looking for a new way to store and take notes. While I loved Apple Notes there was something about the apple lock in that just didn't do it for me. That's when I came across Obsidian. Let me tell you this was the game changer. I'll get into that another time but what Obsidian did show me is just how powerful markdown files can be.

Another year went by of me just working and living my life. That's when I found Astro. That ticked all of the boxes for me. A simple html and css first system? Sign me up! I've had enough with trying to cram Nextjs into everything. It's over kill most of the time.

That leads us to where we are today!
